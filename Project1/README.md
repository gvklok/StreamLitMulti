## Problem Statement

### üéØ Objective
Develop an artificial neural network (MLP) system to identify the optimal 5-player basketball team from a pool of 100 NBA players, ensuring position balance and basketball strategic considerations.

### üìã Requirements
1. **Data Selection**: Select 100 players from NBA dataset within a 5-year window
2. **Team Definition**: Define "optimal team" based on basketball characteristics to avoid unbalanced teams (e.g., all shooters, no defenders)
3. **Player Selection**: Identify optimal team of 5 players from the pool
4. **Neural Network Architecture**: Implement MLP with input layer, hidden layers, and output layer
5. **Training Process**: Include forward propagation, error calculation, backpropagation, and weight updates
6. **Deployment**: Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

### üèÄ Basketball Context
In basketball, team success requires position specialization:
- **Point Guard (PG)**: Primary ball handler, playmaker (assists priority)
- **Shooting Guard (SG)**: Scoring focus, perimeter shooting
- **Small Forward (SF)**: Versatile, balanced skills
- **Power Forward (PF)**: Rebounding and interior presence
- **Center (C)**: Dominant rebounder, interior defense and scoring

The challenge is to avoid creating unbalanced teams (e.g., 5 scorers with no playmakers or defenders).

## Algorithm of the Solution

### üóÉÔ∏è Data Preparation

#### Step 1: Dataset Loading and Filtering
```python
# Load NBA dataset
df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)

# Apply 5-year window filter
recent_seasons = all_seasons[-5:]  # Last 5 seasons
df = df[df['Season'].isin(recent_seasons)]

# Select 100 players randomly
if len(df) > 100:
    df = df.sample(n=100, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)
```

#### Step 2: Position Assignment
Players are assigned positions based on physical and statistical characteristics:
```python
def assign_positions(self, df):
    for _, player in df.iterrows():
        height = player.get('Height', 75)
        assists = player.get('APG', 2)
        
        if height < 74 or assists > 6:      # Short or high assists
            pos = 'PG'
        elif height < 77 and assists > 3:  # Medium height, good playmaking
            pos = 'SG'
        elif height < 79:                  # Medium-tall
            pos = 'SF'
        elif height < 82:                  # Tall
            pos = 'PF'
        else:                              # Very tall
            pos = 'C'
```

### üéØ Label Creation (Optimal Player Definition)

#### Step 3: Position-Specific Weighting System
We define "optimal" players using position-specific performance weights:

```python
position_weights = {
    'PG': {'APG': 0.4, 'PPG': 0.3, 'TS_PCT': 0.2, 'Net_Rating': 0.1},
    'SG': {'PPG': 0.4, 'TS_PCT': 0.3, 'APG': 0.2, 'Net_Rating': 0.1}, 
    'SF': {'PPG': 0.3, 'RPG': 0.25, 'APG': 0.2, 'TS_PCT': 0.15, 'Net_Rating': 0.1},
    'PF': {'RPG': 0.35, 'PPG': 0.3, 'TS_PCT': 0.2, 'Net_Rating': 0.15},
    'C': {'RPG': 0.4, 'PPG': 0.25, 'TS_PCT': 0.2, 'Net_Rating': 0.15}
}
```

**Rationale**: 
- **PG**: Assists weighted 40% (primary playmaker)
- **SG**: Scoring weighted 40% (primary scorer)
- **SF**: Balanced across all skills (versatile player)
- **PF**: Rebounding weighted 35% (interior presence)
- **C**: Rebounding weighted 40% (dominant rebounder)

#### Step 4: Composite Score Calculation
For each player, calculate position-relative performance:
```python
def create_improved_labels(self, df):
    composite_scores = []
    
    for _, player in df.iterrows():
        score = 0
        position = player.get('Position', 'SF')
        weights = position_weights.get(position, position_weights['SF'])
        
        # Calculate weighted score based on position percentiles
        for feature, weight in weights.items():
            if feature in df.columns:
                pos_players = df[df['Position'] == position]
                percentile = (pos_players[feature] <= player[feature]).mean()
                score += weight * percentile
        
        composite_scores.append(score)
    
    # Use 60th percentile threshold
    threshold = np.percentile(composite_scores, 60)
    labels = [1 if score > threshold else 0 for score in composite_scores]
    
    return np.array(labels)
```

**Key Decision**: Used 60th percentile threshold, meaning:
- **Top 40% of players** = "Optimal" (label = 1)
- **Bottom 60% of players** = "Not Optimal" (label = 0)

This creates realistic class distribution while maintaining basketball logic.

### üß† Neural Network Architecture

#### Step 5: MLP Design
```python
def build_mlp_model(self, input_shape):
    hidden_layers = (128, 64, 32)  # 3 hidden layers
    
    model = MLPClassifier(
        hidden_layer_sizes=hidden_layers,
        activation='relu',              # ReLU for hidden layers
        solver='adam',                 # Adam optimizer
        alpha=0.01,                    # L2 regularization
        learning_rate='adaptive',       # Adaptive learning rate
        learning_rate_init=0.01,       # Initial learning rate
        max_iter=500,                  # Maximum epochs
        early_stopping=True,           # Prevent overfitting
        validation_fraction=0.15,      # 15% validation set
        n_iter_no_change=15,           # Early stopping patience
        batch_size=16,                 # Mini-batch size
        random_state=42                # Reproducibility
    )
    return model
```

**Architecture Details**:
- **Input Layer**: 25+ features (player statistics, enhanced features)
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 128 neurons + ReLU activation
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 64 neurons + ReLU activation  
- **Hidden Layer 3**: 32 neurons + ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron + Sigmoid activation (binary classification)
- **Total Parameters**: ~10,000+ trainable weights and biases

#### Step 6: Feature Engineering
Enhanced features for improved performance:
```python
def create_enhanced_features(self, df):
    # Interaction features
    feature_df['Efficient_Scoring'] = df['PPG'] * df['TS_PCT']  # Quality scoring
    feature_df['Rebounding_Per_Inch'] = df['RPG'] / (df['Height'] + 1e-6)  # Size-adjusted rebounding
    feature_df['Playmaking_Efficiency'] = df['APG'] / (df['USG_PCT'] + 1)  # Pure playmaking skill
    
    # Age-based features
    feature_df['Prime_Years'] = ((df['Age'] >= 24) & (df['Age'] <= 30)).astype(int)  # Peak performance
    feature_df['Age_Squared'] = df['Age'] ** 2  # Non-linear age effects
    
    # Position-specific normalization (Z-scores within position)
    for pos in df['Position'].unique():
        pos_mask = df['Position'] == pos
        for col in ['PPG', 'RPG', 'APG']:
            if col in df.columns and pos_mask.sum() > 1:
                pos_mean = df.loc[pos_mask, col].mean()
                pos_std = df.loc[pos_mask, col].std() + 1e-6
                feature_df[f'{col}_Position_Zscore'] = (df[col] - pos_mean) / pos_std
    
    return feature_df
```

### üöÄ Training Process

#### Step 7: Data Preprocessing and Training
```python
def train_model(self, X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=16, verbose=True):
    # Handle class imbalance
    class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y), y=y)
    
    # Stratified split to maintain class distribution
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
    )
    
    # Feature scaling with RobustScaler (handles outliers better)
    X_train_scaled = self.scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = self.scaler.transform(X_test)
    
    # Multiple training attempts for stability
    best_score = 0
    best_model = None
    
    for random_state in [42, 123, 456]:
        temp_model = self.build_mlp_model(X_train_scaled.shape[1])
        temp_model.set_params(random_state=random_state)
        
        # Cross-validation for model selection
        cv_scores = cross_val_score(temp_model, X_train_scaled, y_train, 
                                   cv=3, scoring='f1_macro')
        avg_score = cv_scores.mean()
        
        if avg_score > best_score:
            best_score = avg_score
            best_model = temp_model
    
    # Train best model
    best_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
    self.model = best_model
    
    return training_results
```

#### Step 8: Forward Propagation Process
The neural network performs the following forward pass:

1. **Input Layer**: Normalized player features (25+ dimensions)
2. **Hidden Layer 1**: `z‚ÇÅ = W‚ÇÅ·µÄx + b‚ÇÅ`, `a‚ÇÅ = ReLU(z‚ÇÅ)` (128 outputs)
3. **Hidden Layer 2**: `z‚ÇÇ = W‚ÇÇ·µÄa‚ÇÅ + b‚ÇÇ`, `a‚ÇÇ = ReLU(z‚ÇÇ)` (64 outputs)
4. **Hidden Layer 3**: `z‚ÇÉ = W‚ÇÉ·µÄa‚ÇÇ + b‚ÇÉ`, `a‚ÇÉ = ReLU(z‚ÇÉ)` (32 outputs)
5. **Output Layer**: `z‚ÇÑ = W‚ÇÑ·µÄa‚ÇÉ + b‚ÇÑ`, `≈∑ = Sigmoid(z‚ÇÑ)` (1 output)

#### Step 9: Backpropagation and Weight Updates
The network uses Adam optimizer for gradient-based learning:

1. **Loss Calculation**: Binary cross-entropy loss
   ```
   L = -[y¬∑log(≈∑) + (1-y)¬∑log(1-≈∑)]
   ```

2. **Gradient Computation**: Automatic differentiation through network layers

3. **Weight Updates**: Adam optimizer with adaptive learning rates
   ```
   W = W - Œ± ¬∑ ‚àáW (with momentum and bias correction)
   ```

### üë• Team Selection Algorithm

#### Step 10: Optimal Team Selection
```python
def select_optimal_team(self, df_with_predictions):
    optimal_team = []
    positions = ['PG', 'SG', 'SF', 'PF', 'C']
    
    for pos in positions:
        pos_players = df_with_predictions[df_with_predictions['Position'] == pos]
        if len(pos_players) > 0:
            # Select player with highest AI confidence score
            best_player = pos_players.loc[pos_players['Optimal_Score'].idxmax()]
            optimal_team.append(best_player)
    
    return optimal_team
```

**Selection Strategy**: Choose the player with the highest AI confidence score from each position, ensuring:
- Exactly 5 players (one per position)
- Position balance (PG, SG, SF, PF, C)
- AI-optimized based on learned patterns
